# Rock Paper Scissors Game using Teachable Machine Image Model
    


This repository contains a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game using the Teachable Machine Image Model with java programming language. The model is trained to recognize hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors, allowing you to play the classic game against the computer using your webcam.

## How to Play

1. Click on the "Start" button to initialize the webcam and load the image model.
2. Place your hand in front of the webcam and make one of the following gestures:
   - Rock: Make a fist with your hand.
   - Paper: Spread your fingers open.
   - Scissors: Make a V sign with your index and middle fingers.
3. The model will analyze your gesture and make its prediction.
4. The result of the game will be displayed below the webcam feed, showing whether you won, lost, or tied with the computer.

## Requirements

- A compatible browser with access to the webcam.
- A stable internet connection to load the required TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine libraries.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the `my_model` folder to your web server or hosting environment.
3. Replace the placeholder image link in the readme with your actual image (if you want to include an image preview).
4. Ensure that the `model.json` and `metadata.json` files are present in the `my_model` folder.


## About

This project is a fun demonstration of using a pre-trained image model to play the Rock Paper Scissors game. It is intended for educational and entertainment purposes and can be used as a starting point to explore more complex machine learning projects.

Feel free to customize and experiment with the code to add new features or use the image model for other creative applications!

Enjoy playing Rock Paper Scissors with the Teachable Machine Image Model! ü§ñüëä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è
